# Face Identity Disentanglement via Latent Space Mapping - Implement in pytorch with StyleGAN 2

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07728
Official TensorFlow Implementation: https://github.com/YotamNitzan/ID-disentanglement

## Description
Pytorch implementation of the paper Face Identity Disentanglement via Latent Space Mapping for both training and evaluation, with StyleGAN 2.
(maybe we can upload the pdf to google drive and put here the link)

## Setup
All the weight files we used are available at the attach link: [weight files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18K5YBBJRiCIradtttlLcdtSyLUo3cUI5?usp=sharing)
## Training

### Dataset
The dataset is comprised of StyleGAN-generated images and W latent codes, both are generated from a single StyleGAN model.
We also use real images from FFHQ to evaluate quality at test time.
## Results

## Checkpoints
Our pretrained 256x256 checkpoint (need to add the link for the checkpoint!!!) is also available.
